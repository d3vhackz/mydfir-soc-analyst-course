# Active Directory & Kerberos Refresher

## Kerberos Authentication Protocol

### üé´ Overview and Purpose

Kerberos serves as the cornerstone authentication protocol for Active Directory environments, providing secure identity verification through a ticket-based system that eliminates the need to transmit passwords across the network.

**Core Principle**: "Never trust, always verify" - Each access request requires cryptographic proof of identity

---

## Kerberos Architecture Components

### üèõÔ∏è Key Distribution Center (KDC)

The KDC operates as the trusted third party in Kerberos authentication, consisting of two primary services:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Key Distribution Center - KDC] --> B[Authentication Service - AS]
    A --> C[Ticket Granting Service - TGS]
    
    B --> B1[‚úì Initial user authentication<br/>‚úì Issues Ticket Granting Tickets<br/>‚úì Validates user credentials]
    
    C --> C1[‚úì Service ticket generation<br/>‚úì Resource access authorization<br/>‚úì Permission validation]
    
    style A fill:#e3f2fd
    style B fill:#f3e5f5
    style C fill:#e8f5e8
```

#### **Component Functions**:

| Service | Port | Primary Function | Security Role |
|---------|------|------------------|---------------|
| **Authentication Service (AS)** | 88 | Initial user authentication | Issues TGTs after credential validation |
| **Ticket Granting Service (TGS)** | 88 | Service access authorization | Issues service tickets for resource access |

## Kerberos Authentication Workflow

### üîÑ Six-Step Authentication Process

Understanding this workflow is crucial for identifying authentication anomalies and potential attacks:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User as Domain User
    participant KDC as Key Distribution Center
    participant Service as Target Service/Application
    
    Note over User,Service: Phase 1: Initial Authentication
    User->>KDC: 1. Authentication Request (Authenticator)
    KDC->>User: 2. TGT + Session Key (if valid)
    
    Note over User,Service: Phase 2: Service Access Request
    User->>KDC: 3. TGT + Service Request
    KDC->>User: 4. Service Ticket (TGS)
    
    Note over User,Service: Phase 3: Service Access
    User->>Service: 5. Service Ticket (TGS)
    Service->>User: 6. Access Granted (if authorized)
```

#### **Detailed Step Analysis**:

**Step 1: Initial Authentication**
- User provides credentials (username/password)
- System creates encrypted authenticator
- **Security Note**: Credentials never transmitted in plaintext

**Step 2: TGT Issuance**
- KDC validates user credentials against AD database
- Issues Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) with session key
- **Lifetime**: Typically 10 hours (configurable)

**Step 3: Service Request**
- User presents TGT to request service access
- TGT proves prior authentication to KDC
- **Security Benefit**: No re-authentication required

**Step 4: Service Ticket Generation**
- KDC validates TGT and user permissions
- Issues service-specific ticket (TGS)
- **Contains**: User identity, service permissions, expiration

**Step 5: Service Access Attempt**
- User presents service ticket to target resource
- Ticket contains encrypted authorization data
- **Validation**: Service uses its secret key to decrypt

**Step 6: Access Decision**
- Service validates ticket authenticity
- Grants access based on user permissions
- **Audit**: Access attempt logged for monitoring

## Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)

### üè¢ Enterprise Directory Infrastructure

AD DS provides the foundational directory services that enable Kerberos authentication and centralized resource management.

#### **Core Capabilities**:

## Active Directory Terminology

### üìö Essential AD Concepts for SOC Analysts

Understanding AD terminology is crucial for investigating authentication-related incidents:

| Term | Definition | Security Relevance |
|------|------------|-------------------|
| **Domain** | Logical collection of AD objects with shared security policies | Security boundary for policies and access |
| **Object** | Individual entities (users, computers, groups) stored in AD | Attack targets and privilege escalation paths |
| **Group Policy Object (GPO)** | Collection of policy settings applied to users/computers | Common target for persistence and privilege escalation |
| **Organizational Unit (OU)** | Logical container for organizing AD objects | Delegation boundary and administrative scope |
| **Domain Controller (DC)** | Server hosting AD database and providing authentication | Critical infrastructure component and high-value target |
| **Domain Computer** | Machine joined to the AD domain | Potential attack vector and lateral movement target |
| **Schema** | Definition of object types and attributes in AD | Determines what objects can exist and their properties |
| **LDAP** | Protocol for accessing directory information | Common reconnaissance and enumeration vector |
| **Forest** | Collection of domains sharing schema and configuration | Trust boundary and administrative scope |

## AD Forest and Domain Structure

### üå≥ Hierarchical Organization

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Forest: contoso.com] --> B[Root Domain: contoso.com]
    A --> C[Child Domain: sales.contoso.com]
    A --> D[Child Domain: engineering.contoso.com]
    
    B --> B1[OUs, Users, Computers]
    C --> C1[Sales Team Objects]
    D --> D1[Engineering Objects]
    
    A --> E[Global Catalog]
    A --> F[Schema]
    A --> G[Configuration]
    
    style A fill:#ffeb3b
    style B fill:#e3f2fd
    style C fill:#e8f5e8
    style D fill:#fce4ec
```

#### **Security Boundaries**:
- **Forest**: Ultimate security boundary - complete trust within forest
- **Domain**: Administrative boundary - trust relationships configurable
- **OU**: Delegation boundary - granular administrative control

## Kerberos Security Implications

### üîí Attack Vectors and Monitoring

SOC analysts must understand common Kerberos-based attacks:

#### **Common Kerberos Attacks**:

| Attack Type | Description | Detection Method |
|-------------|-------------|------------------|
| **Golden Ticket** | Forged TGT using KRBTGT hash | Monitor for unusual TGT properties and lifetime |
| **Silver Ticket** | Forged service ticket using service account hash | Watch for direct service access without TGT |
| **Kerberoasting** | Extract service account password hashes | Monitor TGS requests for service accounts |
| **ASREPRoasting** | Target accounts without Kerberos pre-authentication | Look for AS-REQ without pre-auth |
| **Pass-the-Ticket** | Replay stolen Kerberos tickets | Monitor for ticket reuse across systems |
| **Overpass-the-Hash** | Use NTLM hash to request Kerberos tickets | Detect unusual authentication patterns |

#### **Monitoring Indicators**:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Kerberos Monitoring] --> B[Authentication Anomalies]
    A --> C[Ticket Abuse]
    A --> D[Service Account Activity]
    
    B --> B1[Unusual login times<br/>Geographic anomalies<br/>Failed auth spikes]
    
    C --> C1[Long-lived tickets<br/>Unusual ticket properties<br/>Cross-domain usage]
    
    D --> D1[Service account logins<br/>High-privilege requests<br/>Unusual service access]
```
