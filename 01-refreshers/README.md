# 01 - Refreshers Module

## üìö Module Overview

This module provides essential foundational knowledge refreshers for SOC analysts. These topics form the backbone of cybersecurity operations and are crucial for understanding advanced security concepts covered in later modules.

The refreshers cover core security principles, networking fundamentals, DNS operations, email security, Active Directory authentication, and cloud computing basics with a focus on Microsoft Azure.
