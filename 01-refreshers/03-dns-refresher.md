# DNS Refresher

## Domain Name System Fundamentals

### üåê Purpose and Function

The Domain Name System (DNS) serves as the internet's phonebook, translating human-readable domain names into machine-readable IP addresses that enable network communication.

```
Human Request: "Take me to google.com"
DNS Translation: google.com ‚Üí 142.250.191.14
Result: Browser connects to Google's servers
```

## Protocol Architecture

### üì° DNS Communication Protocols

DNS operates on both TCP and UDP protocols, each serving specific purposes:

| Protocol | Port | Primary Use | Characteristics |
|----------|------|-------------|-----------------|
| **UDP** | 53 | Standard queries | Fast, lightweight, most common |
| **TCP** | 53 | Zone transfers | Reliable, for large data transfers |

```mermaid

    A[DNS Client] -->|UDP Query<br/>Fast Response| B[DNS Server]
    C[DNS Server A] -->|TCP Zone Transfer<br/>Reliable Data| D[DNS Server B]
    
    B -->|UDP Response<br/>Quick Resolution| A
```

> **SOC Insight**: Monitor for unusual TCP DNS traffic, as it may indicate zone transfer attempts or DNS tunneling attacks.

## DNS Resolution Process

### üîç Step-by-Step Domain Resolution

Understanding the DNS resolution hierarchy is crucial for identifying attack vectors and troubleshooting network issues.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User as User Browser
    participant Local as Local Machine
    participant Cache as Local DNS Server
    participant ISP as Router/ISP
    participant Root as Root Server
    participant TLD as TLD Server (.com)
    participant Auth as Authoritative Server
    
    User->>Local: 1. Check hosts file
    Local-->>User: Not found
    
    User->>Cache: 2. Query local DNS cache
    Cache-->>User: Not found
    
    User->>ISP: 3. Query router/ISP
    ISP-->>User: Not found
    
    ISP->>Root: 4. Query root server
    Root-->>ISP: Refer to .com TLD
    
    ISP->>TLD: 5. Query .com TLD server
    TLD-->>ISP: Refer to authoritative server
    
    ISP->>Auth: 6. Query authoritative server
    Auth-->>ISP: Return IP address
    
    ISP-->>User: 7. Return resolved IP
    Note over Cache: 8. Cache result until TTL expires
```

#### Resolution Hierarchy Breakdown:

1. **Local Hosts File**: Manual IP-to-domain mappings on local machine
2. **Local DNS Cache**: Recently resolved domains stored temporarily
3. **Router/ISP DNS**: First external DNS resolver
4. **Root Servers**: 13 global servers directing to TLD servers
5. **TLD Servers**: Top-level domain authorities (.com, .org, .net)
6. **Authoritative Servers**: Definitive source for domain information
7. **Caching**: Store results locally until Time-To-Live (TTL) expires

## Domain Structure Hierarchy

### üèóÔ∏è Domain Name Components

Understanding domain structure helps identify legitimate vs. suspicious domains:

```
Full Domain Structure: www.google.com.
                       ‚îÇ    ‚îÇ     ‚îÇ  ‚îÇ
                   Subdomain ‚îÇ     ‚îÇ  ‚îÇ
                        2nd Level   ‚îÇ  ‚îÇ
                            Top Level  ‚îÇ
                                  Root
```

#### Component Breakdown:

| Component | Example | Purpose | Security Notes |
|-----------|---------|---------|----------------|
| **Root Domain** | `.` | Internet's top level | Usually implicit |
| **Top Level Domain (TLD)** | `.com` | Domain category | Monitor suspicious TLDs |
| **Second Level Domain** | `google` | Organization identifier | Primary brand indicator |
| **Subdomain** | `www` | Service/department | Often used in attacks |

> **Threat Detection**: Attackers often use similar-looking subdomains or TLDs to create deceptive domains (e.g., `www.g00gle.com`).

## DNS Record Types

### üìã Essential DNS Records for SOC Analysts

DNS records contain various types of information beyond simple IP address mapping:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[DNS Records] --> B[Address Records]
    A --> C[Service Records]
    A --> D[Administrative Records]
    A --> E[Security Records]
    
    B --> B1[A - IPv4 Address]
    B --> B2[AAAA - IPv6 Address]
    B --> B3[PTR - Reverse Lookup]
    
    C --> C1[CNAME - Alias]
    C --> C2[MX - Mail Exchange]
    C --> C3[SRV - Service Location]
    
    D --> D1[SOA - Start of Authority]
    D --> D2[NS - Name Server]
    D --> D3[TXT - Text Information]
```

#### Record Type Reference:

| Record | Full Name | Purpose | Example | Security Relevance |
|--------|-----------|---------|---------|-------------------|
| **A** | Address | IPv4 address mapping | `example.com ‚Üí 192.168.1.1` | Primary attack target |
| **AAAA** | IPv6 Address | IPv6 address mapping | `example.com ‚Üí 2001:db8::1` | IPv6 security monitoring |
| **CNAME** | Canonical Name | Domain aliasing | `www.example.com ‚Üí example.com` | Redirect chain analysis |
| **MX** | Mail Exchange | Email server location | `mail.example.com priority 10` | Email security routing |
| **SOA** | Start of Authority | Zone information | Contains admin details | Zone transfer security |
| **NS** | Name Server | Authoritative server | `ns1.example.com` | DNS infrastructure mapping |
| **SRV** | Service | Service + port mapping | `_http._tcp.example.com` | Service enumeration |
| **PTR** | Pointer | Reverse DNS lookup | `1.1.168.192.in-addr.arpa` | IP reputation checking |
| **TXT** | Text | Miscellaneous data | SPF, DKIM, verification | Often contains security policies |
